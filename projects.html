                <h3>Schedule Builder</h3>
                <p>
                    Created a web application to build possible schedules for
                    a set of classes. The application uses a database of classes
                    and the sections offered in each class. The user selects
                    some classes, and the application creates a list of possible
                    schedules, which the user can view and save to local
                    storage on the browser. Done as a project for a web
                    applications class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Status: Complete. <br />
                    Possible changes: Change database to use university's server
                    so app can be used outside of cloud9. Fix display issue on
                    saved schedules page. Implement more efficient algorithm for
                    coming up with possible schedules. Suggest what classes to
                    remove when no schedules could be made due to conflicts.

                <h3>To Do List</h3>
                <p>
                    Created a windows to-do-list app to keep track of tasks
                    such as assignments. It allows users to add tasks with
                    descriptions, set the dates on which they are to be
                    completed, and check them off when completed. Tasks can
                    also be set as repeatable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Status: On hold. Working, but with bugs to be ironed out.
                    <br />
                    Possible additions: A refresh button, better visual design,
                    redeveloping the load/save mechanism to make it more robust.

                <h3>ACM Programming Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                    Solved problems from the ACM programming challenge (ICPC).
                    Started out as class assingments, but I continued as
                    preparation for participating in the contest in the Fall of
                    2016.

                <h3>Surround Game</h3>
                <p>
                    Wrote a simple Surround game as part of a class pair
                    programming project. The objective of the game is to remain
                    the last player on the board, while eliminating other
                    players by surrounding their pieces on the board from four
                    sides.

                    Possible additions: A smart AI, a more robust file
                    hierarchy, a game manual.

                    Designed this personal website from scratch. It's made up
                    of 7 web pages (possibly more to come), with content files
                    stored separately of the webpages, and scripts to load and
                    display the content dynamically using AJAX.
