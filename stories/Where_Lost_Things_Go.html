<h2>Where Lost Things Go</h2> <p>Bright light streamed through the open door,
and Stewart woke up. It took his rusty brain a few moments to orient itself. He
was in the backseat of a car. He had fallen asleep on the way. They must have
arrived, or the door wouldn&rsquo;t be open.<br><br>&ldquo;Dad, are you awake?
Come on, we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Yes, yes, just&hellip; give me a
moment,&rdquo; he said, his voice sounding hoarse.<br><br>Slowly, shakily, he
got out of the car and looked around. He stood at the entrance to a mansion,
complete with fountains, gothic windows and marble statues guarding the front
doors. It was huge, magnificent in its splendor.<br><br>But what was he doing
here? And where was Marge? He looked around. He saw Claire, his daughter. She
looked beautiful &ndash; tall, elegant, poised. Aristocratic. That&rsquo;s
right, this was Claire&rsquo;s house. Hid daughter&rsquo;s home. And his, too,
now.<br><br>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s...&rdquo; he begun, but then shook his head,
remembered. Marge was gone. A sadness filled his eyes, but he refused to cry.
He&rsquo;d done enough of that already. He felt alone, but then remembered that
he wasn&rsquo;t. He had Claire. Her and her husband. And his niece, whom he was
yet to meet, but who was inside, waiting for him in the
house.<br><br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, dad,&rdquo; Claire said gently, linking her
arm in his, supporting his bent body.<br><br>He nodded in response, and they
headed for the front doors.<br><br><br>Stewart placed the photo album beside the
night lamp and lay back into the soft, comfy bed. He had enjoyed dinner together
with his daughter and in-law. The niece seemed like a nice enough girl, too.
Quiet, but respectful. She&rsquo;d shown him around a bit, and he remembered
being impressed, even if he couldn&rsquo;t remember what had impressed
him.<br><br>He&rsquo;d asked for the album when he saw Margery&rsquo;s picture
on the cover. There were so many memories in those photographs&hellip; Some
pictures he remembered, some he didn&rsquo;t. He sighed &ndash; he was really
tired. His eyes closed, and he drifted off into a blissful
slumber.<br><br><br>Stewart opened his eyes. It was morning. He could tell because
the light spilled in through the slits in between the red curtains. They were
not his curtains. Where was he? His heartbeat rose. He sat up, fast, causing a
wave of pain to course through his back. And then he calmed down as he recalled
the events of yesterday. He was at Claire&rsquo;s. He was safe. He let his
breath out, and got up. Maybe the breakfast would be ready. He should brush his
teeth.<br><br>By the time he got to the dining room, breakfast had indeed been
served, and everyone but him was already seated.<br><br>&ldquo;Morning,
Stewart,&rdquo; his in-law, David, greeted him. &ldquo;We were waiting for you
to come down.&rdquo;<br><br>Stewart smiled. They had waited for him. The simple
gesture made him feel welcome. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; He took his seat beside
his niece. With a pang of guilt, he realized that he&rsquo;d forgotten her name.
Don&rsquo;t worry, he told himself. It&rsquo;ll come up in
conversation.<br><br>It did. Her name was Christy. Christy, Christy, Christy,
the old man repeated mentally in his head, determined not to forget it again. It
took him a while to realize that someone was talking to
him.<br><br>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I said,&rdquo; Claire said, louder
this time, &ldquo;are you done with the album?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;What
album?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;You borrowed it yesterday. The photo
album.&rdquo;<br><br>I didn&rsquo;t&hellip; oh, yes, yes&hellip; I finished
looking through it. Lovely photos&hellip; I left it beside the night lamp.
I&rsquo;ll go get it later.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s
alright,&rdquo; David piped in, then shouted, &ldquo;Walter!&rdquo;<br><br>A few
moments later, a butler walked into the dining room. &ldquo;You called,
sir?&rdquo; He walked and talked stiffly, as if on
auto-pilot.<br><br>&ldquo;Yes, go up to Stewart&rsquo;s room and get the album
and put it back on the shelf. It&rsquo;s next to the lamp. The album, not the
shelf.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Walter replied and walked out. A
few minutes and half a chicken wing later, he was back.<br><br> &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t there, sir.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Are you
sure?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;<br><br>Stewart frowned.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s where I placed it.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Go
check again, Walter, and do it properly this time,&rdquo; Claire said, clearly
irritated.<br><br>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; the butler replied
emotionlessly, and was gone.<br><br>Ten minutes later, he was back. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t there, sir, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;<br><br>Everyone&rsquo;s heads turned
to Stewart. &ldquo;I&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip; I was sure I put it
there&hellip;&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting a bit
forgetful&hellip; Must&rsquo;ve picked it up again, you know? I&rsquo;ll find
it.&rdquo;<br><br>His daughter dismissed the butler and turned to him.
&ldquo;Please do that, dad. There are pictures of mom in there&hellip; They help
me feel like she&rsquo;s still watching me,&rdquo; she said
softly.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find it,&rdquo; Stewart repeated. His niece
looked at him with an expression that seemed to be full of pity.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find it.&rdquo;<br><br>But he
didn&rsquo;t.<br><br><br>Stewart&rsquo;s wrinkled face stared back at him from the
mirror. His sparse, grey hair was messy, and he needed to shave. It was his eyes
that he couldn&rsquo;t look away from, however. They were wide,
scared.<br><br>He was going crazy.<br><br>He knew it. Things kept on vanishing
around him. Things he had seen, touched, admired, asked for. And he never knew
where to find them. He must be having blackouts. Memory loss. But he
couldn&rsquo;t let them know. They&rsquo;d send him to a home. He didn&rsquo;t
want to go to a home. He&rsquo;d seen what it was like before. His friend,
Wally, had been admitted there after he started walking around outside in his
underwear. Stewart had gone to visit, once. He never went back for a second
visit. It felt eerie, like he was looking at his own future. No, no, he
couldn&rsquo;t go there! He wouldn&rsquo;t!<br><br>His eyes were starting to
bulge. He calmed himself down by taking deep breaths. When h thought he looked
good enough, he left the bathroom and headed down the hallway, back towards his
room.<br><br>Suddenly, everything began to look unfamiliar. The portraits were
wrong. This wasn&rsquo;t the way back. He turned around, walked past the
bathroom in the opposite direction. Walked up a flight of wooden stairs. Came to
a junction. Which turn was the right one? He couldn&rsquo;t remember. He picked
the left one, and kept on walking. He couldn&rsquo;t afford to get lost. It
would be the same as buying a ticket to an old people&rsquo;s home. But he was
lost. He knew it.<br><br>He decided to backtrack his steps to the bathroom.
Maybe if he stayed there for a while and thought, he&rsquo;d remember how
he&rsquo;d gotten there in the first place. But a few steps in, he realized that
he couldn&rsquo;t remember the way to the bathroom, either. Why was the mansion
so huge? He felt panic rising from his gut. He had to calm down.<br><br>That was
when he heard the argument.<br><br>&ldquo;-rulous. He&rsquo;s perfectly
fine.&rdquo; Stewart recognized Claire&rsquo;s voice.<br><br>&ldquo;Fine?
Claire, he got lost twice yesterday alone, and he&rsquo;s been here for three
weeks already!&rdquo; David&rsquo;s voice exclaimed.<br><br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s
just old, Dave. And the mansion is huge. I got lost all the time when I first
came here myself,&rdquo; his wife protested.<br><br>&ldquo;What about all the
missing stuff then? Things have been getting missing ever since he came here. He
says he doesn&rsquo;t remember anything about them. He&rsquo;s either lying, or
having severe memory loss.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;David
&ndash;&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I saw him hold that statuette, Claire, but after it
went missing, bam! He doesn&rsquo;t remember anything about it. Either way,
it&rsquo;s not normal.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;So what? Just get another one. Lord
knows we have the money.&rdquo;<br><br>There was a pause, and then the argument
resumed, but muffled this time. Stewart could only catch a few words from it.
Home. Stealing. Not. Dad. They must have moved further away from the door. He
walked away from them, heart pounding. David had started suspecting. He had to
find a way to show them that he was ok. Maybe if he found the missing things, he
could say he remembered everything and they&rsquo;d leave him alone. Yes, that
was what he was going to do.<br><br>A few turns later, he ran into
Christy.<br><br>&ldquo;Did you get lost again?&rdquo; she asked gently, her face
screwed up in concern.<br><br>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he lied, trying to put as much
dignity into the word as he could. &ldquo;I was just&hellip;
exploring.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Of course you were,&rdquo; she smiled
sympathetically, and then linked her arm in his. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you back
to your room.&rdquo;<br><br><br>&ldquo;Has anybody seen my watch?&rdquo; Stewart
stood in the doorway to the dining room, looking imploringly at his
family.<br><br>They all shook their heads no. &ldquo;What watch?&rdquo; Claire
asked.<br><br>&ldquo;I have to find it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, then started
rummaging through the counters lining the walls. He knocked over a lamp, but
didn&rsquo;t bother to right it up.<br><br>&ldquo;Stewart! Relax, it&rsquo;s
just a watch! We&rsquo;ll get you a new one!&rdquo; David said
loudly.<br><br>Stewart wheeled around to glare at him, face red.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just a watch!&rdquo; his hoarse voice thundered.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the watch Marge gave me for our 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary!
It&rsquo;s the last&hellip; the last gift I got from her.&rdquo; His voice
quaked. &ldquo;My last piece of her, and I&rsquo;d&hellip; I&rsquo;d gone and
lost it!&rdquo;<br><br>He couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore. It was all too much
for him to handle. He sunk to his knees and broke out into huge, body-shuddering
sobs. He thought he heard footsteps, and then someone put a hand over his
shoulders, hugged him, tried to comfort him.<br><br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,
Dad. We&rsquo;ll help you find it. We&rsquo;ll find it, I promise.&rdquo;
Claire. Stewart looked up, his tear-stained expression blank.<br><br>&ldquo;Find
what?&rdquo;<br><br><br>The old man walked along the hallway, looking into the rooms
as he passed them. He was searching for the library. In such a big mansion,
there was bound to be a library, he reasoned. There was something important
nagging on his mind, but he couldn&rsquo;t for the life of him remember what it
was, so he dismissed it. It didn&rsquo;t matter, though. If he didn&rsquo;t
think about it, he wouldn&rsquo;t get stressed. He started humming a
song.<br><br>After a while, he forgot what he was looking for. He stopped for a
while, but then kept on going and peeking into doors, all the while humming to
himself. If he saw it, he&rsquo;d probably remember what he was looking
for.<br><br>In one room, something caught his attention. Something glinted from
inside of a half-open jewelry box. Stewart hesitated, then walked towards it. It
was a watch. With a twinge of glee, he realized it was his watch. He put it on,
looked around. There was an album lying on a table. It had marge&rsquo;s picture
on the cover. He smiled, touched his fingers to the photo.<br><br>Something was
wrong. Something about the items in the room was nagging at his memory. There
was a brooch, a bunch of necklaces, a few statuettes&hellip; he began examining
them.<br><br>As he put down the second statuette and turned his attention to an
ornate swan-shaped hairclip, he heard footsteps. Someone walked into the room.
He looked around. It was Christy. She held a comb in her mind. She looked up,
saw him. Her eyes widened, and, too late, she hid the comb behind her back. But
something had clicked in Stewart&rsquo;s mind, and for a moment, he remembered
everything clearly.<br><br>&ldquo;It was you!&rdquo; he shouted, an accusatory
finger pointed at his niece. &ldquo;You stole all those
things!&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t mean to,&rdquo; she
stammered, looking around in alarm, not wanting anyone to hear them. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t help it, it just&hellip; it just sort of happens from time to time,
okay?&rdquo;<br><br>She looked so distraught that Stewart&rsquo;s anger abated
enough for him to lower his voice. &ldquo;They all think I&rsquo;m crazy because
of you,&rdquo; he accused her.<br><br>&ldquo;I know, and I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;
I just&hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t tell them. You have to understand, they&rsquo;ll
send me away to an institution. I don&rsquo;t want that,&rdquo; she
pleaded.<br><br>A silence grew between them, becoming more and more awkward with
each passing second. It was Christy who broke first under its weight.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she repeated softly. &ldquo;I just couldn&rsquo;t
do it&hellip;&rdquo;<br><br>Stewart thought for a minute, then raised his head
and asked, &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t do what?&rdquo;<br><br>Christy studied him for
a while, saw his blank expression. She sighed, put the comb down on top of the
album, and took the old man&rsquo;s arm.<br><br>&ldquo;Come on, Stewart,
let&rsquo;s get you out of here.&rdquo;<br><br><br>That evening, he sat in the back
of the van, looking out towards the mansion. Claire, David and Christy all stood
outside, gazing back at him. Even Walter was there, his face bearing its usual
expressionless mask. Claire was crying for some reason. Stewart wanted to go
give her a hug, but he was already in the van, and the door was
locked.<br><br>The van started moving. He waved at his family. Claire leaned
into her husband. Christy mouthed something to him, but he couldn&rsquo;t catch
what it was. He was being taken somewhere, that much he knew. He couldn&rsquo;t
remember where, but it was alright. As long as he didn&rsquo;t think about it
too deeply, he&rsquo;d be okay.</p>
