<h2> Deathbed </h2>
<p> The old man coughed, his small, gnarled body shaking
from pain and age. His eyes gazed upwards, towards the roof of the small hut in
which he lay, but he was not seeing it. His thoughts took his vision back into
the depths of his memory, when he was young and whole, and had everything to
live for. He remembered the days when his father taught him to hunt. He
remembered the smiling, angelic face of his wife as she held their firstborn
child. Those were the good memories. He remembered the graves, which he had dug
out and marked by himself. First, there were the two graves for his parents, who
had died together. Then, there was a small one for a stillborn baby. His wife
had cried for weeks after that. And then, finally, another grave for his wife.
He was already old then, and it was the hardest grave he had to dig. Those were
the sad memories. <br><br> He reached up with a trembling hand, and touched his
face, feeling the wrinkles on his forehead, counting them. One, two, three,
four, five&hellip; It was said that the more wrinkles an old man had on his
forehead, the wiser he was. It was a lie. The old man did not feel wise. He had
made mistakes, a lot of them, and old age hadn&rsquo;t seemed to reduce the
number he made. His son did not dig his grave. That said it all, really. How
foolish must a man be to make his own son hate him so? He had found a wife for
himself since he left. Or so he&rsquo;d heard. His son hadn&rsquo;t bothered to
tell him. What was her name, they said? He couldn&rsquo;t remember. His memory
was failing him these days. <br><br> The old man sighed heavily, the sharp
rising of his chest sending a shiver of pain through his body. He kept
forgetting how frail he had become. In his youth, he was fit, athletic,
powerful. He had been proud of his body, proud of what he could do, the fear he
could bring into the eyes of those who opposed him. Now, he was ashamed to look
at himself. No amount of exercise, or good food, or medicine, could bring back
the muscles to his skinny arms, or smooth out the wrinkles on his once perfect
skin, or make his bones strong enough to support his weight, meager as it was,
without creaking. He was broken now, helpless. All he could do was lie in his
bed, waiting for his time to come. <br><br> He tried to focus on the roof of the
hut, but everything was blurry. Even so, he could see a few dark spots where
there were holes in the roof and the water leaked in when it rained. A few years
ago, he could have fixed it. A few months ago, he could have put a basin
underneath the cracks to collect the water. Now, someone was sent here a few
times a day to do that for him, and to make sure he was still breathing. It hurt
his pride, but he suffered it quietly. The village did not forget its own, even
if they were old and broken and of no use anymore. That was a comforting
thought. <br><br> The old man coughed again, and felt a few drops of something
wet land on his beard. It might be blood. Or it could be just spittle. Either
way, the cough had hurt, and his throat now burned, but it was a dull burning,
as if his body couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to pay it any more heed. His breath
wheezed out of his mouth as he sighed again. He knew that he wouldn&rsquo;t have
long to wait. He wished it was true, what they said. That he would join his
ancestors as a star in the sky. <br><br> It was a belief among the elders of the
village. When a man died, the gods would lift him up and place him among the
stars, to watch over his children from above. Or, at least, that&rsquo;s what
the wise men said. It was also said that the brightness of the star reflected
the gods&rsquo; appraisal of the man. In his youth, he often scoffed at this
notion, earning harsh looks from the elders. But now&hellip; now, he understood
them. When you&rsquo;re young, these things seem absurd, the muttering of senile
old men with nothing better to do than make up legends. But, when you can hear
the slow footsteps of death as he shuffled up to your doorstep, you needed to
believe in something. If you didn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;d go insane. The old man
did not want to go insane, so he&rsquo;d come to cling to the belief. It was all
he had left. <br><br> He felt a numbness beginning to spread through his body.
It was almost time. He knew it. Fear gripped him, and he wanted to cry out, but
his pride, as well as the soreness of his throat, wouldn&rsquo;t allow it. He
wasn&rsquo;t going to disappear, he consoled himself as the numbness continued
to spread inwards. He would rise up, and soar into the skies, to be rid of all
worldly pains for good. He would be able to watch over his son every night, when
the sun wasn&rsquo;t bright enough to color the skies blue. And then, when his
son was gone from this world, they would meet again, as two stars in the sky,
and he would finally be able to apologize. His son would forgive him, and they
would spend eternity just watching the world go by and reminiscing about old
times.  Gods, he wished it were true. A single tear formed in his eye
and rolled down his cheek. <br><br> And then the darkness took him.</p>
