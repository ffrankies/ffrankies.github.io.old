        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is Frank (ffrankies is my usual internet
            pseudonym). Currently, I am a Junior studying computer
            science at Grand Valley State University in Michigan, USA.
            Where I hail from is somewhat more complicated. I was born in
            Kharkiv, Ukraine, lived out most of my early childhood in
            Russia, and then moved to Ghana, the country whose citizenship
            I now claim. You could say I'm a bit of a global citizen.
            <br><br>
            I've mentally played around with many careers, from
            minivan driver (in my defense, I was 4 or 5, and being paid to
            drive sounded like Heaven on Earth), to a cartoonist, to a
            singer (that one didn't last long, thankfully), to an engineer.
            I finally settled on something computer-ey when I realized how
            much time I spent staring at my screen and thought: "Hey, I
            might as well do something useful while I'm at it." I've never
            really looked back since then. There are just so many things
            you can do with the right coding knowledge; from making
            websites to automating robots to simulating life (probably).
            <br><br>
            I would describe myself as a curious person, in the
            sense that I like to try out new stuff, so long as said 'new
            stuff' doesn't involve heights or spices. This curiousity is
            what drove me to try coding the first time, to try different
            forms of art (like fractals and digital art), to start writing,
            to download duolingo and start learning Italian, to buy a
            'learn to play piano' book and start practicing on my
            roommate's keyboard... Well, you get the point. I always have
            at least four different things I'm "trying out", and I wouldn't
            have it any other way.
            <br><br>
            As you might have guessed from the above paragraph, I have way
            too many hobbies, and I periodically jump to and fro between
            them like some kind of confused rabbit. I am an avid reader
            (current record is finishing three novels in a single Saturday).
            Like pretty much every male under 30, I enjoy my video games. I
            <a href="gallery.html">draw</a>, I <a href="library.html">
            write</a>, I make periodic attempts to learn Italian. I
            actively-passively support AC Milan. I'm learning to play the
            keyboard, I play football (soccer) passably, and tennis
            (poorly), and I can stand around in ice skates without
            immediately falling. I rock out to the Beatles, Florence and the
            Machine, and Michael Jackson, and I think Vikings is the best
            thing to happen to television since Game of Thrones. Oh, and I
