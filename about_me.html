            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, my name is Frank (ffrankies is my usual internet pseudonym).
                Currently, I am a Sophomore studying computer science at Grand
                Valley State University in Michigan, USA. Where I hail from is
                somewhat more complicated. I was born in Kharkiv, Ukraine,
                lived out most of my early childhood in Russia, and then moved
                to Ghana, the country whose citizenship I now claim. You could
                say I'm a bit of a global citizen.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've mentally played around with many careers, from minivan
                driver (in my defense, I was 4 or 5, and being paid to drive
                sounded like Heaven on Earth), to a cartoonist, to a singer
                (that one didn't last long, thankfully), to an engineer. I
                finally settled on something computer-ey when I realized how
                much time I spent staring at my screen and thought: "Hey, I
                might as well do something useful while I'm at it." I've never
                really looked back since then. There are just so many things
                you can do with the right coding knowledge; from making websites
                to automating robots to simulating life (probably).
            </p>
            <p>
                I would describe myself as a curious person, in the sense that
                I like to try out new stuff, so long as said 'new stuff' doesn't
                involve heights or spices. This curiousity is what drove me to
                try coding the first time, to try different forms of art (like
                fractals and digital art), to start writing, to download
                duolingo and start learning Italian, to buy a 'learn to play
                piano' book and start practicing on my roommate's keyboard...
                Well, you get the point. I always have at least four different
                things I'm "trying out", and I wouldn't have it any other way.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you might have guessed from the above paragraph, I have way
                too many hobbies, and I periodically jump to and fro between
                them like some kind of confused rabbit. I am an avid reader
                (current record is finishing three novels in a single Saturday).
                Like pretty much every male under 30, I enjoy my video games.
                I draw, I write, I make periodic attempts to learn Italian. I
                actively-passively support AC Milan. I'm learning to play the
                keyboard, I play football (soccer) passably, and tennis
                (poorly), and I can stand around in ice skates without
                immediately falling. I rock out to the Beatles, Florence and
                the Machine, and Michael Jackson, and I think Vikings is the
                best thing to happen to television since Game of Thrones. Oh,
                and I code.
