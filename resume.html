            <p>
                An international student and sophomore at Grand Valley State
                University, studying Computer Science. A dependable fast learner
                who is able and willing to learn on the go, looking for a summer
                internship position in software/application development.
                Experience coding in Java, C++, the MIPS assembly language, and
                HTML/CSS. By the end of this semester, I will also gain
                experience coding in SQL, and hopefully Javascript.
