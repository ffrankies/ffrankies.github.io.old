            <p>
                <span>The</span> old man coughed, his small, gnarled body
                shaking from pain and age. His eyes gazed upwards, towards the
                roof of the small hut in which he lay, but he was not seeing it.
                His thoughts took his vision back into the depths of his memory,
                when he was young and whole, and had everything to live for. He
                remembered the days when his father taught him to hunt. He
                remembered the smiling, angelic face of his wife as she held
                their firstborn child. Those were the good memories. He
                remembered the graves, which he had dug out and marked by
                himself. First, there were the two graves for his parents, who
                had died together. Then, there was a small one for a stillborn
                baby. His wife had cried for weeks after that. And then,
                finally, another grave for his wife. He was already old then,
                and it was the hardest grave he had to dig. Those were the sad
                memories.
                <br><br>
                <span>He</span> reached up with a trembling hand, and touched his face,
                feeling the wrinkles on his forehead, counting them. One, two,
                three, four, five... It was said that the more wrinkles an old
                man had on his forehead, the wiser he was. It was a lie. The
                old man did not feel wise. He had made mistakes, a lot of them,
                and old age hadn't seemed to reduce the number he made. His son
                did not dig his grave. That said it all, really. How foolish
                must a man be to make his own son hate him so? He had found a
                wife for himself since he left. Or so he'd heard. His son
                hadn't bothered to tell him. What was her name, they said? He
                couldn't remember. His memory was failing him these days.
                <br><br>
                <span>The</span> old man sighed heavily, the sharp rising of his chest
                sending a shiver of pain through his body. He kept forgetting
                how frail he had become. In his youth, he was fit, athletic,
                powerful. He had been proud of his body, proud of what he could
                do, the fear he could bring into the eyes of those who opposed
                him. Now, he was ashamed to look at himself. No amount of
                exercise, or good food, or medicine, could bring back the
                muscles to his skinny arms, or smooth out the wrinkles on his
                once perfect skin, or make his bones strong enough to support
                his weight, meager as it was, without creaking. He was broken
                now, helpless. All he could do was lie in his bed, waiting for
                his time to come.
                <br><br>
                <span>He</span> tried to focus on the roof of the hut, but everything was
                blurry. Even so, he could see a few dark spots where there were
                holes in the roof and the water leaked in when it rained. A few
                years ago, he could have fixed it. A few months ago, he could
                have put a basin underneath the cracks to collect the water.
                Now, someone was sent here a few times a day to do that for him,
                and to make sure he was still breathing. It hurt his pride, but
                he suffered it quietly. The village did not forget its own, even
                if they were old and broken and of no use anymore. That was a
                comforting thought.
                <br><br>
                <span>The</span> old man coughed again, and felt a few drops of something wet
                land on his beard. It might be blood. Or it could be just
                spittle. Either way, the cough had hurt, and his throat now
                burned, but it was a dull burning, as if his body couldn't be
                bothered to pay it any more heed. His breath wheezed out of his
                mouth as he sighed again. He knew that he wouldn't have long to
                wait. He wished it was true, what they said. That he would join
                his ancestors as a star in the sky.
                <br><br>
                <span>It</span> was a belief among the elders of the village. When a man
                died, the gods would lift him up and place him among the stars,
                to watch over his children from above. Or, at least, that's what
                the wise men said. It was also said that the brightness of the
                star reflected the gods' appraisal of the man. In his youth, he
                often scoffed at this notion, earning harsh looks from the
                elders. But now... now, he understood them. When you're young,
                these things seem absurd, the muttering of senile old men with
                nothing better to do than make up legends. But, when you can
                hear the slow footsteps of death as he shuffled up to your
                doorstep, you needed to believe in something. If you didn't,
                you'd go insane. The old man did not want to go insane, so he'd
                come to cling to the belief. It was all he had left.
                <br><br>
                <span>He<span> felt a numbness beginning to spread through his body. It was
                almost time. He knew it. Fear gripped him, and he wanted to cry
                out, but his pride, as well as the soreness of his throat,
                wouldn't allow it. He wasn't going to disappear, he consoled
                himself as the numbness continued to spread inwards. He would
                rise up, and soar into the skies, to be rid of all worldly pains
                for good. He would be able to watch over his son every night,
                when the sun wasn't bright enough to color the skies blue. And
                then, when his son was gone from this world, they would meet
                again, as two stars in the sky, and he would finally be able to
                apologize. His son would forgive him, and they would spend
                eternity just watching the world go by and reminiscing about old
                times.
                <br><br>
                <span>Gods</span>, he wished it were true. A single tear formed in his eye
                and rolled down his cheek.
                <br><br>
                <span>And</span> then the darkness took him.
