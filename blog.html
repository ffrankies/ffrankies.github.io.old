            <h2>My Experiments</h2>
            <h3><a name="e1"></a>Experiment 1 | The Site!</h3>
            <p>
                <span>Benvenuto!</span> This is my very first blog post, talking about this
                very website. First off - the name. It's a little... weird, so
                I thought I should spend some time explaining how I ended up
                choosing it. This website is hosted through GitHub pages, which
                requires that the site's domain name be in the form
                'username.github.io', and my username just happened to be
                ffrankies, due to a combination of a crazy classmate I had in
                high school, and the fact that frankie and frankies were
                already taken. My plan is to post about things I try to do/make.
                In other words, 'experiments', and experiments are done in the
                lab, hence "ffrankies' laboratory". Also, it sounds a bit like
                Dexter's lab, and that cartoon was the bomb.
                <br><br>
                <span>Now</span>, on to the important stuff. I've been playing around with
                creating my own website for a while now, but never got around
                to it because I couldn't think of what to put in it, and
                because I didn't want to pay a monthly fee for hosting. But
                then, I heard about GitHub pages, and found out that Codecademy
                had a free html and css course that didn't involve any pesky
                videos, and I decided to go with it. Although at the time of
                writing, the site isn't complete, the total amount of time I
                expect it to take to populate all the pages and make them
                usable is about 3 weeks. And that's including learning html and
                css, so I'm considering this a pretty darn good pace.
            <br><br>
                <span>All</span> the code on this site was written entirely by me - no third
                party themes of any kind were used. The color scheme and layout,
                which I'm reasonably happy with, were inspired by AC Milan's
                club colours, and a design I saw on DeviantArt for a digital
                portfolio, respectively. I played around with a lighter colour
                scheme, but the result was kind of bland, so I decided to stick
                with the current, darker theme.
            <br><br>
                <span>I</span> don't consider the site finished, however. I am still playing
                around with the idea of changing the domain name to one that
                doesn't involve 'github' and 'io', and while css is pretty cool
                on it's own, it doesn't make for quite as interesting websites
                as those containing some javascript or jquery code. So, the plan
                going forward is to spend some time learning the two languages
                and slowly transitioning this site from static to dynamic. Well,
                that, and populating the last two pages of the site.
            <br><br>
                <span>That</span>'s all for now. Thanks for reading! If you read this in
                February of 2016, you're probably the very first reader, and
                I'm sending you a 100 internet points, which are exactly as
                meaningless and imaginary as they sound, but are still pretty
                cool.
