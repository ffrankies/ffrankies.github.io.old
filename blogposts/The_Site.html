<h2>Experiment 1 | The Site!</h2>
<p>
     Benvenuto! This is my very first blog post,
    talking about this very website. First off - the name. It's a
    little... weird, so I thought I should spend some time
    explaining how I ended up choosing it. This website is hosted
    through GitHub pages, which requires that the site's domain
    name be in the form 'username.github.io', and my username just
    happened to be ffrankies, due to a combination of a crazy
    classmate I had in high school, and the fact that frankie and
    frankies were already taken. My plan is to post about things I
    try to do/make. In other words, 'experiments', and experiments
    are done in the lab, hence "ffrankies' laboratory". Also, it
    sounds a bit like Dexter's lab, and that cartoon was the bomb.
    <br><br> Now, on to the important stuff. I've been
    playing around with creating my own website for a while now,
    but never got around to it because I couldn't think of what to
    put in it, and because I didn't want to pay a monthly fee for
    hosting. But then, I heard about GitHub pages, and found out
    that Codecademy had a free html and css course that didn't
    involve any pesky videos, and I decided to go with it. Although
    at the time of writing, the site isn't complete, the total
    amount of time I expect it to take to populate all the pages
    and make them usable is about 3 weeks. And that's including
    learning html and css, so I'm considering this a pretty darn
    good pace. <br><br> All the code on this site was
    written entirely by me - no third party themes of any kind were
    used. The color scheme and layout, which I'm reasonably happy
    with, were inspired by AC Milan's club colours, and a design I
    saw on DeviantArt for a digital portfolio, respectively. I
    played around with a lighter colour scheme, but the result was
    kind of bland, so I decided to stick with the current, darker
    theme. <br><br> I don't consider the site
    finished, however. I am still playing around with the idea of
    changing the domain name to one that doesn't involve 'github'
    and 'io', and while css is pretty cool on it's own, it doesn't
    make for quite as interesting websites as those containing some
    javascript or jquery code. So, the plan going forward is to
    spend some time learning the two languages and slowly
    transitioning this site from static to dynamic. Well, that, and
    populating the last two pages of the site. <br><br>
    That's all for now. Thanks for reading! If you
    read this in February of 2016, you're probably the very first
    reader, and I'm sending you a 100 internet points, which are
    exactly as meaningless and imaginary as they sound, but are
    still pretty cool.
