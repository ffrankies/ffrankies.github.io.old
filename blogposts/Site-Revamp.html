<h3>Experiment 2 | Site Revamp</h3>
<p>Once again, benvenuto to <strong>ffrankie's laboratory</strong>!
It has been pretty empty in here for quite a while due to our lead
scientist (me), who also happens to be our only scientist, as well
as our only lab rat, being unavailable due to external
circumstances (exams, homework, projects, a possible research
opportunity, and more exams). However, we did not spend all that
time forgetting about the site's existence. And so, we present
here, a still on-going revamp on the site.<br>
<br>
Firstly, we have received mixed reviews about the previous color
scheme of the website. Some have said that they like the dark
scheme, others have criticized its lack of color. We here at the
lab held a vote, and came upon an unanimous decision to brighten up
the place. Partly because we thought it would be cool, and partly
because we couldn't pick one color, we decided that every page
would be styled with a different color scheme. The current color
*configuration* can be previewed by looking at the new homepage -
each link corresponds to the color scheme of the webpage it links
to. It should be noted, however, that at the time of writing of
this post, only the new index page is done and up, everything else
is still under construction and will be available on a rolling
basis in the near future.<br>
<br>
Also, we were recently introduced to an amazing site called
<a href="http://codepen.io">codepen</a>, where web developers share
code for interesting animations and designs that they've developed.
We here at the lab felt like we should get in on that, and started
experimenting with hover effects and minor animations. We actually
spent a lot of time on a background animation involving growing and
shrinking rectangles, but decided it was too distracting and
replaced it with a bunch of smaller animations on the index page.
As our (my) skills improve, we expect to add more, and better,
animations and better designs to the site. After all, building up
on previous experiments is what science is all about, isn't it?<br>
<br>
Finally, from a more technical perspective, we have started to
slowly organize our code. Previously, everything but the blogposts,
stories and art was stored in the root directory, because we felt
that 7 pages wasn't much to keep track of. However, the stylesheets
quickly became annoyingly long, and the home directory started to
get clogged up, so we have introduced sub-directories for
javascript and css files. We have also learned more about
responsive design, and decided to break our stylesheets into 4 for
each page: one stylesheet for small screens (like phones), another
for bigger screens (like tablets), and another for even bigger
screens (like laptops), as well as a separate stylesheet holding
most of the animations. The smallest screens do not show
animations, and the site still looks best, in our opinion, on
laptops, but it is nevertheless viewable on smaller screens.
Another note on css, as we get more conversant with css, we are
reducing our dependence on javascript for styling, which is as it
should be - that's not what javascript is for. Our new index page,
for instance, uses absolutely no javascript at the moment, and we
are pretty proud of that.<br>
<br>
That's about it for our site revamp. Expect to see more changes in
the upcoming days, and soon we may have another post about our new
project in the artificial intelligence field, about teaching
computers how to learn, and the possibility of making computers
creative!</p>
