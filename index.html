        <h1> Experiment 1 | The Site! </h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to ffrankie's lab! This is my personal webpage, which
            will contain stuff like my contact information, resume, attempts at
            creating art, and programming projects. I am treating this website
            as a programming project, so this is Experiment 1, brought to you by
            ffrankie's lab!
        </p>
        <p>
            This site is still in the design/creation stage, so expect some
            stuff to look funky/not work properly. Everything will be fixed in
            short order though. No worries, eh?
        </p>
        <p>

            This is one of my proudest works - a variant of a Grand Julian
            created and rendered using the free program Apophysis 7X.
